This project is made to use our miniLibX skills, to discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.

This project’s goal was to create a small fractal exploration program.

The constraints were as follows:
• THe software should offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
• The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer).
• It use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal.
• A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be viewed. If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits properly.
• More parameters must be used for fractal parameters or ignored.
• It can create different Julia set with the parameters of the program.
• ESC will exit the program.

Bonus part :
• One or more different fractal.
• The zoom follows the actual mouse position.
• In addition to the zoom: moving with the arrows.
• The color range shift.
